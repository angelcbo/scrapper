Weight-based dosing:
-First dose: 13 mg/kg salt (10 mg/kg base) orally
-Second dose (6 hours after first dose): 6.5 mg/kg salt (5 mg/kg base) orally
-Third dose (24 hours after first dose): 6.5 mg/kg salt (5 mg/kg base) orally
-Fourth dose (48 hours after first dose): 6.5 mg/kg salt (5 mg/kg base) orally

Maximum Dose:
-First dose: 800 mg salt (620 mg base)/dose
-Second, third, and fourth dose: 400 mg salt (310 mg base)/dose

Comments:
-Concomitant therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline compound is necessary for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax and P ovale infections.

Use: For the treatment of uncomplicated malaria due to P falciparum, P malariae, P ovale, and P vivax

US CDC Recommendations: 620 mg base (800 mg salt) orally at once, followed by 310 mg base (400 mg salt) orally at 6, 24, and 48 hours
Total dose: 1550 mg base (2000 mg salt)

Comments:
-Recommended for uncomplicated malaria (P falciparum or species not identified) in regions with chloroquine sensitivity
-Recommended for uncomplicated malaria (P malariae, P knowlesi, P vivax [unless chloroquine-resistant P vivax suspected], or P ovale) in all regions; if treating P vivax or P ovale infections, concomitant treatment with primaquine (after quantitative testing to rule out glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD] deficiency) is recommended.
-Recommended for uncomplicated malaria treatment for pregnant women in regions with chloroquine sensitivity
-Current guidelines should be consulted for additional information.
Usual Adult Dose for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus:
200 to 400 mg salt (155 to 310 mg base)/day orally divided in 1 or 2 doses

Comments:
-Doses above 400 mg/day are not recommended.
-Higher incidence of retinopathy reported when this maintenance dose is exceeded.

Uses: For the treatment of chronic discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus
Usual Adult Dose for Rheumatoid Arthritis:
Initial dose: 400 to 600 mg salt (310 to 465 mg base)/day orally divided in 1 or 2 doses
Maintenance dose: 200 to 400 mg salt (155 to 310 mg base)/day orally divided in 1 or 2 doses
Maximum dose: 600 mg salt (465 mg base)/day or 6.5 mg/kg salt (5 mg/kg base)/day, whichever is lower

Comments:
-The action of this drug is cumulative and may require weeks to months to achieve the maximum therapeutic effect.
-When a good response is obtained, the initial dose may be reduced by 50% and continued at a maintenance dose.
-Higher incidence of retinopathy reported when this maintenance dose is exceeded; 600 mg salt (465 mg base) or 6.5 mg/kg salt (5 mg/kg base), whichever is lower, should not be exceed per day.
-Corticosteroids and salicylates may be used with this drug, and they can generally be decreased gradually in dosage or eliminated after a maintenance dose of this drug has been achieved.

Use: For the treatment of acute and chronic rheumatoid arthritis
